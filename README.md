- Contact: pyzhang@cs.stanford.edu
- Description: This repo hosts the FPGA code and MacBook Pro software needed for running the FreeRider system. We demonstrate that FreeRider can inject data on top of existing 802.11g/n WiFi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee traffic. 

## License
- The source code of the FreeRider system is distributed under academic license to ensure the reproducibility of our results. The source code can NOT be used for commercial purpose.

## Repo
- backscattering_ofdm repo includes the code of doing codeword translation when the excitation signal is an 802.11g/n WiFi signal.

- backscattering_bluetooth repo includes the code of doing codeword translation when the excitation signal is a Bluetooth signal.

- backscattering_zigbee repo includes the code of doing codeword translation when the excitation signal is a ZigBee signal.
